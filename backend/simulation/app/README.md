# Fleet Simulation Service

This simulation service creates virtual cars and moves them along predefined routes for fleet management testing and telemetry. Each car sends timeseries data to a backend and checks for geofence events as it moves.

---

##  What Does It Do?

- **Reads routes** from a `processed_routes.json` file (generated by google service generation progtam).
- **Creates simulated cars** with random but realistic attributes.
- **Moves each car** back and forth along its assigned route, step by step.
- **Sends telemetry data** (location, speed, fuel, etc.) to a backend microservice at each step.
- **Checks geofence status** every 10 steps via a backend API (in app folder).
